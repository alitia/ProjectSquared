NOTES FROM CARLOS
1) Use typescript - there is a create-react-app and pass in typescript argument which will set it up.
		--- will also add pretty. Auto format on save
2) 'Style components' - CSS
3) Unsplash - CC images like Trellos background
4) Seperate communication to the database from the main class. Middle man class gets the data, processes it, and then gives it to the view.
5) https://github.com/storybooks/storybook - Testing individual components in isolation.
6) Jest - Testing
7) WallabyJS - Tests your code as you type
8) Switch to Visual Studio Code
9) Form IK: Validation - uses SUP
10) Check the recommended way of connecting up components with the database
