1) Fixed? Project Title does not display at the same time as the progress bar
2) Progress calc has not been designed for multiple checkbox groups, only one so far
3) Fixed? New data does not save if the unit has not been refreshed 
4) Unit ID generator is not very good as it only tries twice - this really needs to be iterating on the last used value
5) Huge list of content editable errors




Next steps:
whenever add field is pressed, a new edit field is added to the list
whenever add field is added, it is saved to firebase
all changes to fields are saved to firebase
