1) Fixed? Project Title does not display at the same time as the progress bar
2) Progress calc has not been designed for multiple checkbox groups, only one so far
3) Fixed? New data does not save if the unit has not been refreshed 
4) Unit ID generator is not very good as it only tries twice - this really needs to be iterating on the last used value
5) Huge list of content editable errors





Currently when a new project is being created, if the page is refreshed the project is recreated
instead of recongising that the project already exists
